description: Apply Ives-standard aesthetic refinement to current UI components.
---
1. Deconstruct the current UI into Atoms, Molecules, and Organisms.
2. Apply the Zinc-950 Mastery palette (Zinc-900, Zinc-950, Translucency).
3. Implement "Glassmorphism" tokens where appropriate (backdrop-blur).
4. Integrate Framer Motion micro-interactions for all state changes.
5. Verify "Time-to-Wow" is < 60 seconds.
